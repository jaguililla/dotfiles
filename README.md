Dotfiles
========

This project holds configuration files and scripts for some of the programs and operating systems I
use.

Configuration Files
-------------------

The settings for the backed up programs are stored in a folder per application or system. These are:

* Archlinux: shell configuration files and install script.
* Cygwin: bash settings and [Mintty](http://code.google.com/p/mintty/) terminal emulator
  configuration file.
* Eclipse: IDE preferences, code formatter, save actions, key bindings, etc.
* Windows: Vim configuration files and [Auto Hot Key](http://www.autohotkey.com/) script.

All bash files should be copied to user home (~) with a point (.) before the name. Ie:
profile -> ~/.profile

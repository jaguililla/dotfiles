# Dotfiles
This project holds configuration files and scripts for some programs and operating systems I use.

The settings for the backed up programs are stored in a folder per application or system (sometimes
grouped by a directory). More information can be found in `README.md` files inside subdirectories.

Some deprecated programs' settings were deleted, but they can be found inside repository tags.

## TODO
* Create `install.sh` scripts to install independent modules.
* Run set up scripts based on the OS (i.e.: different commands for Linux and macOS)
* Add Scoop section for Windows

```bash
scoop bucket add extras
scoop bucket add nerd-fonts
scoop install neovim
scoop install unxutils
scoop install jetbrainsmono-nf-mono jetbrainsmono-nf
```
